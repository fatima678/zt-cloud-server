SSL certificate is an automated certificate that verifies a website’s identity and allows an encrypted link. When your browser displays the “

SSL stands for Secure Sockets, a protection agreement that makes an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser.SSL is generally used on the Internet by an increasing number of applications, specifically for relations that exchange confidential details such as credit card numbers.
What is the Cause of Connection is not secure?

The connection is insecure due to the lack of encryption protocols or a false SSL/TLS certificate, potentially revealing data to interception or manipulation by malicious parties.
