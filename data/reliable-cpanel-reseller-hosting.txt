CPanel reseller hosting is a type of web hosting service that allows all individuals or businesses to resell web hosting services under their brand name. With cPanel reseller hosting, the reseller purchases a hosting plan from a web hosting company and then sells portions of that plan to their clients, often at a markup.
The reseller hosting plan typically includes a control panel, such as cPanel, that allows the reseller to create and manage multiple hosting accounts for their clients. The reseller can customize these accounts to meet the needs of their clients, such as setting up
email accounts
, installing applications, and managing website files.
CPanel reseller hosting is a popular option for individuals and businesses who want to start their own web hosting business without the cost and resources required to set up their own data center and infrastructure.
